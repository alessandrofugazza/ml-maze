# ml-maze

This algorithm executes multiple runs over and over and learns from previous runs in order to find the shortest path to the solution/exit.
 
Use https://www.dcode.fr/maze-generator to generate the maze. 

Save it as .txt in the same folder as the .py file

Make sure to add walls at bottom right to close the maze and add an "x" where you want the solution to be

Also add a return after the last line or the program won't work.

Expected output:

**NOTE** The mazes the website generates seem to have only one optimal solution so there's not much room for learning. Replace some walls inside the maze (the "#") with empty spaces to see the learning part of the algorithm in action.
